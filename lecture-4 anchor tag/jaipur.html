           Jaipur (Rajasthani: Jayapura, pronounced [ˈd͡ʑɛpʊɾᵊ]) is the capital and the largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in the old city.[11]

Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh II, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named.[12] It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[13] During the British colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After Indian independence in 1947, Jaipur became the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan in 1949.

Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India, forming a part of the Western Golden Triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra.[14] The city serves as a gateway to other tourist destinations in Rajasthan, such as Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur, Bundi, Kota, and Mount Abu; it has two World Heritage sites, Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar. On 6 July 2019, the city was placed on the World Heritage Cities list.[15] It is also known as the Paris of India. Due to its beauty, C.V. Raman called it the "Island of Glory".

           </h2>
           <center>
            Jaipur derives its name from Sawai Jai Singh II, the Kachhwaha ruler of Amer, who founded the city in 1727.[11] In Sanskrit, variations of the word "pur" or "pura" are commonly used
            to refer to a city or town. So "Jaipur" essentially means "The City of Jai" or "Jai's City".[16]

            Jaipur was founded by the Rajput chief of Kachhwaha clan, Jai Singh II, on 18 November 1727, who ruled the region from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water.[17] Jai Singh consulted with several architects while planning the layout of Jaipur and established the city based on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra, under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[18] The construction of the city began in 1726. During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh II, the city was painted pink to welcome Albert Edward, Prince of Wales in 1876.[19] Many of the avenues remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink City.[20]

In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and had a population of 160,000 by 1900. <br>

            The wide boulevards were paved, and its chief industries included metalwork and marble, fostered by a school of art founded in 1868.[21] In August 1981, large areas of the city including the airport, were flooded due to heavy rains from a cloudburst, resulting in the deaths of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River.[22][23] On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.[24]

            Jaipur is located in the northeastern part of Rajasthan and covers a total area of 467 square kilometres (180 sq mi). The city is surrounded by fertile alluvial plains to the east and south, and hill chains and desert areas to the north and west.[25][26] Jaipur generally slopes downwards from north to south and then to the southeast.[27] The city is surrounded by the Nahargarh hills in the north and Jhalana in the east, which is a part of the Aravalli range.[27]

The Dravyavati River is the primary drainage channel, which by 2014 had degenerated into an untreated sewage nallah. To address this issue, a plan for the rejuvenation of the river was developed by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) in 2015.[28] A 13 km (8.1 mi) stretch of Dravyavati riverfront out of 47.5 km (29.5 mi) was opened after rejuvenation in 2018 and the remaining project was completed in 2022.[29]

            Jaipur has a monsoon-influenced hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with long, extremely hot summers and short mild to warm winters. Annual precipitation is over 625 millimetres or 25 inches, falling mostly in July and August due to the southwest monsoon, causing the average temperatures in these two months to be lower compared to drier May and June. During the monsoon, there are frequent, heavy rains and thunderstorms, but flooding is not common. The highest temperature ever recorded was 49.0 °C (120.2 °F), on 23 May 1994. The city's average temperature remains below 20 °C or 68 °F between December and February. These months are mild, dry, and pleasant, sometimes chilly. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −2.2 °C (28.0 °F) on 31 January 1905, 1 February 1905, and 16 January 1964. Jaipur, like many other major 
            cities of the world, is a significant urban heat island zone with surrounding rural temperatures occasionally falling below freezing in winters.[30]

            The city was planned according to the Indian Vastu shastra by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya in 1727.[106] Three gates are facing east, west, and north. The eastern gate is called Suraj pol (sun gate), the western gate is called Chand pol (moon gate) and the northern gate faces the ancestral capital of Amer.[18][107] The architecture of the city was heavily influenced by the 17th century architectural renaissance during Mughal rule in Northern India. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.[108] The city is unusual among pre-modern Indian cities in the regularity of its streets, and the division of the city into six sectors by broad streets 34 m (111  ft) wide. The urban quarters are further divided by networks of gridded streets. Five-quarters wrap around the east, south, and west sides of a central palace quarter, with a sixth quarter immediately to the east. The Palace quarter encloses the Hawa Mahal palace complex, formal gardens, and a small lake.
             Nahargarh Fort, which was the residence of King Sawai Jai Singh II, crowns the hill in the northwest corner of the old city.[95] <br>
